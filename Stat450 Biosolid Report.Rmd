## Summary
This project report aims to show the results 
•Stands on its own to provide the reader with a clear capsule version of the report.
• Focuses on a clear statement of the problem (a “big picture”), the key methodologies
used and the main results.
• Is less than 10% of the report (with 30% of the summary on the objectives, background,
problem, and methods; 70% on data analysis, results and findings).
• Uses the present tense; indicative mood.

## Introduction
• Stands on its own as a lead-in to present the report.
• Does not summarize the report.
• Does not detail the data analysis and results.
• Provides a broad, general view of the topic and its background.
• Includes a clear statement of the detailed objectives (the problem(s) the report intends
to solve).
• Summarizes the significance, scope and methodology.
• Ends with an overview of the body sections.
• Uses the present tense; indicative mood.

## Results
The data has n=43 observations, each observation is categorized by Species (ASAG, HECO, KOMA or LITT), Block (1,2,3 or 4), Treatment (Biosolids or Control), and has a plant coverages value. The main statistical methods used were ANOVA test and two-sample T-test. Specifically, ANOVA was used to find whether all species(without biosolids treatment) are equally effective, and whether all species(with biosolids treatment) are equally effective. Sample T-tests were used to find whether the population mean for a specific group's cover value is significantly differnt from another's. 

The ANOVA for control group shows 
The ANOVA for treatment group shows 

• Describes the process of data analysis. ***

• Reports the findings. ****
• Uses the past tense to describe the data analysis process and the present tense to
report findings.
Note: Given the explorative nature of problem solving in statistics, **, ***, and **** can be integrated into a step-by-step problem solving process, beginning with data analysis and ending with findings.
## Conclusions and Recommendations

Note: Results here includes Data Analysis which can be a section by itself in a longer report.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}
biosolid <- read.csv("soil_blocks.csv", header = T)
controldata <- subset(biosolid, biosolid$Treatment == "Control")
#str(controldata)
(anova <- aov(y.avg ~ Species, data = controldata))
summary(anova)

treatmentdata <- subset(biosolid, biosolid$Treatment == "Biosolids")
(anova2 <- aov(y.avg ~ Species, data = treatmentdata))
summary(anova2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
